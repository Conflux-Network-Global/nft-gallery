# NFT Gallery

Blockchain should empower and protect creators, not exploit them. The purpose of this gallery space is to uplift, elevate, and provide visibility to artists from emerging markets, traditional artists experimenting with NFTs, and innovators disrupting the status quo. Because we believe in being unique, in original thought and original people. You do you. Because if something is easily definable, itâ€™s probably also not that interesting.
